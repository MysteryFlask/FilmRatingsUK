# FilmRatingsUK
A complex Discord bot that retrieves UK unofficial age ratings and data about films and TV shows using Web Scraping, multiple APIs and some regex.

# Setup

Firstly, make sure Python is installed. For a guide on how to do this, go to https://realpython.com/installing-python/.

Then, install the requires modules for Python, here is the list: import discord, import requests, from bs4 import BeautifulSoup, import re, import asyncio.

Next, download the main.py file from this repository, and note down where it is being stored on your computer.

Finally, open the code in a text editor, I recommend Notepad++, and wherever I have added a note, change that to the value I say there.

# Running

Open a command prompt/terminal and do python [file path] where the path is the file path of the main.py file you just downloaded. An example path would be C:\Users\NAME\Downloads\main.py for Windows or /home/NAME/Downloads/main.py for Linux.

Well Done! It should now succesfully be running, and you can use !tv [tv show/film name] in a server it is in and it should quickly return the data in a clean embed.
